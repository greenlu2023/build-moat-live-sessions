**Frontend** (single-page, one `App.tsx` file): URL input field + Generate button that calls `POST /api/qr/create`. On success, display: the QR code image (via `/api/qr/{token}/image`), the token, the short URL, the original URL target. Show an info panel with created_at, updated_at, expires_at, is_deleted. Show a live countdown timer if expires_at is set, turning red under 10 seconds. Show an Update section (new URL input + PATCH button that resets expiry to +1 minute). Show a Load Analytics button that calls `/api/qr/{token}/analytics` and displays total scans and a per-day breakdown. Show a Delete button that calls `DELETE /api/qr/{token}` and updates UI to show "Deleted — redirect returns 410". Show a Test Redirect button that fetches `/r/{token}` with `redirect: 'manual'` and displays the HTTP status code badge. Status indicator in the header showing Active / Expired / Deleted with color coding.

**Frontend Layout:** All content must be visible on a single screen without vertical scrolling. Use a structured grid layout:
- Row 1 — Header: app title on the left, status badge (Active / Expired / Deleted) on the right.
- Row 2 — Input bar: full-width URL input + Generate button.
- Row 3 — Main panel (2 columns): left column = QR code image (200×200); right column = token/short URL/target info on top, metadata row (created, updated, expires, is_deleted, countdown) below.
- Row 4 — Update bar: new URL input + PATCH button, full width.
- Row 5 — Action bar: Load Analytics, Test Redirect, Delete buttons on the left; HTTP status badge on the right.
- Row 6 — Analytics panel: appears inline when loaded (total scans + compact per-day table).
Use compact font sizes (13–14px) and tight spacing so the full interface fits within a typical laptop viewport (~900px tall).

**Frontend Visual Style — Dark Mode Terminal:**
- Background: `#0d1117` (GitHub Dark base), card/panel surfaces: `#161b22`
- Borders: `#30363d` (subtle, single-pixel)
- Primary accent: `#39d353` (terminal green) for buttons, highlights, active status
- Secondary accent: `#58a6ff` (blue) for links and short URLs
- Danger: `#f85149` (red) for delete, expired, 410 status
- Warning: `#d29922` (amber) for expired status
- Text: `#e6edf3` (primary), `#8b949e` (secondary/labels)
- Font: `'JetBrains Mono', 'Fira Code', monospace` for tokens and URLs; `system-ui, sans-serif` for body copy
- **Minimum font size: 16px.** Labels (uppercase) may use 14px at the smallest. Never go below 14px anywhere in the UI.
- Buttons: flat, no box-shadow, `border: 1px solid` matching accent color, background transparent or dark — no filled solid color blocks
- Status badges: small, pill-shaped, colored dot prefix (●)
- QR code panel: white background island (invert filter not needed — QR must stay readable)
- Do NOT use gradients, drop shadows, rounded corners larger than 6px, or bright saturated fills

**vite.config.ts:** Proxy `/api` and `/r` to `http://localhost:8000` for local dev.
